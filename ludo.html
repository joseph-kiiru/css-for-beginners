        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Initial setup</h2>
        <p>Chess is played on a chessboard, a square board divided into 64 squares (eight-by-eight) of alternating color, which is similar to that used in draughts (checkers) (FIDE 2008). No matter what the actual colors of the board, the lighter-colored squares are called "light" or "white", and the darker-colored squares are called "dark" or "black". Sixteen "white" and sixteen "black" pieces are placed on the board at the beginning of the game. The board is placed so that a white square is in each player's near-right corner. Horizontal rows are called ranks and vertical rows are called files.</p>

            <li>The rooks are placed on the outside corners, right and left edge.</li>
            <li>The knights are placed immediately inside of the rooks.</li>
            <li>The bishops are placed immediately inside of the knights.</li>
            <li>The queen is placed on the central square of the same color of that of the player: white queen on the white square and black queen on the black square.</li>
            <li>The king takes the vacant spot next to the queen.</li>
            <li>The pawns are placed one square in front of all of the other pieces.</li>
        </ol>
